## Introduction
Automated Speech Assessment (ASA) leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Processing to evaluate spoken language quality, focusing on fluency, pronunciation, and linguistic accuracy. It integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe speech and NLP techniques to assess grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. ASA is widely used in language learning, recruitment, and certification to provide instant, objective feedback on speaking proficiency. By combining acoustic analysis with advanced linguistic models, ASA offers personalized insights and supports diverse accents, making it a robust tool for global language assessment need.
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an Automated Speech Assessment System designed to analyze and evaluate speech fluency, pronunciation, grammar, and sentiment. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the system integrates multiple datasets to train robust models for educational and language assessment purposes.

## Repository Structure
The Repository is organized as follows:
